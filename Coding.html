        <p>Many of us think that Coding is boring, indeed it is not...Do you know why? Let me tell you the new tab you open in Google Chrome that is also made using coding{HTML, CSS, JavaScript and many more exciting programming languages...In the Olden Days, we didn't have this type of coding, people used Binary Language. The binary language was hard to understand and code too because it contained only "0s and 1s". Coding has evolved during the times of evolution of man and their creativity.</p>
        <p>Let me tell you a time when I felt coding boring too...</p>
        <p>It all started in the year 2020, May. My dad was working on one of his projects and I saw one of the documents of HTML. It contained more than 1000 lines. I had so many questions, I asked all my questions from my dad and mom... Then they thought of teaching HTML. Since I am a quick learner I learned how to insert an image, add a video link using the anchor tag, add a marquee changing its background color and many more...That is where I started to love coding. Now in ProGrad Junior mentors teach very nicely and give us the freedom to code by ourselves.</p>
